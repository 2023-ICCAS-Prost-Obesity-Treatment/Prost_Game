## 🔗 System Architecture
For the client-side, we utilized Unity. The image recognition process involved Microsoft Azure, 
while Google Firebase served as our database. Node.js was employed to handle server operations. 
When a user uploads a food image through the cellphone, Node communicates with Azure to obtain the result and then sends it back to the client. Game variables and step data stored in Firebase.
